📌 Project Overview

This project predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to analyze how advertising impacts sales and build a model that forecasts future sales to support data-driven marketing decisions.

🎯Objectives

Clean and preprocess advertising data

Perform feature selection and transformation

Build a regression model to predict sales

Evaluate model performance

Analyze the impact of each advertising channel

Provide business insights for budget optimization

⚙️Technologies

Python, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

🔬 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary index columns

Handled missing values

Converted data into proper numeric format

2. Data Transformation

Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler for better model performance

3. Feature Selection

Selected advertising channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) as independent variables

Sales used as dependent variable

4. Model Building

Implemented Multiple Linear Regression

Split dataset into training and testing sets

5. Evaluation

Model performance measured using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

6. Visualization

Feature importance chart

Actual vs Predicted sales plot

Advertising impact analysis

📈 Results

The regression model successfully predicts sales with high accuracy

TV advertising shows the strongest influence on sales

Radio has moderate impact

Newspaper has relatively lower impact

Model can forecast future sales for new advertising budgets

💡 Key Insights

Increasing TV ad spend significantly boosts sales

Optimizing advertising allocation improves marketing ROI

Data-driven budgeting leads to better business decisions

Machine learning can effectively forecast sales outcomes
